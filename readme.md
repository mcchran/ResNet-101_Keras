resnet-101_keras.py code from:
https://github.com/flyyufelix/cnn_finetune/blob/master/resnet_101.py  

The only value I have added to flyyufelix's awesome work is to make the layers calls compatible with the latest Keras 2 API so I don't get those annoying deprecation warnings anymore. Please see his repo for description and for links to download the TensorFlow or Theano network weights.
